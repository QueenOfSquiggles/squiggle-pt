## Pros and Cons

- Move side-table in couch room
    - delete tire pump in there
- Make selection material way more obvious
- Figure out why side room is so intensly bright
- Fix fullscreen? May need more
- Allow the mouse sensitivity to go even lower
- Jumpscare is less effective after a few times and/or when unexpected (no tension building)
- Teardrop can kill through walls if close enough
- Player did not see Teardrop in the chase phase

+ Music is unsettling
+ Doors closing automatically is unnerving
+ Jumpscare is good the first time.
+ Teardrop is unsettling


* Teleport phase is startling but quickly becomes frustrating
* Player thinks the game is timed (it is not)


## End Conversation

Player didn't understand how the monster functioned. Noticed that it becomes aggressive and doesn't chase (appreciated). Player found Teardrop generally unsettling to be around.

**Note**: Player did play with the sound incredibly low


## Ideas

* Add a fourth phase where Teardrop can
* Go slenderman style where looking at the monster is bad? That would limit the player's interaction
* Make the breathing louder in later phases
* Give more lead-time for jump scares
    - During the teleport phase, she caught the player by surprise with a jumpscare, which is not fun nor scary.
